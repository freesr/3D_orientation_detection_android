The goal of this App is to understand the use of sensors on the smartphone to design an
app that produces the 3-D orientation of the phone when placed in your pocket. The key is to
use a combination of the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass on the phone to find the 3-D
orientation of the device. The User interface design for the assignment is up to you, but try to
be creative in illustrating the 3D orientation of the device. You need to follow the requirements
mentioned below.
